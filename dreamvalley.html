        Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Dream Valley found its origins in the dreamy eyes of Mr. Santosh Reddy who hoped for a place where people can come close to nature and experience a connection between the vivid colorfulness of natural flora and their soul. 

        The project was a huge success, and was known as a Resort in collaboration with nature. The theme is to provide a weekend getaway for families who spend working, and do not have time to relax and rejuvenate themselves for the coming week. Taking forward this legacy and providing more to Hyderabad the concept of a Resort with a water park was developed on an area of 20 acres at Bakaram Jagir before Chilkur X Roads.
        
        In the quest for providing more facilities the company is coming out with an exclusive convention center, which will be a great mix and match with nature, all that a convention center needs in an ambiance that is close to nature. And entertainment is an added attraction. This project houses a mega water park on an area of 20 acres, surrounded by greenery and good landscaping all around. The vision of being close to nature is always in the minds of Dream Valley Resorts, thus all things which are natural find a place. The idea is to contribute to the community and also to ensure follow up of all environment friendly practices
